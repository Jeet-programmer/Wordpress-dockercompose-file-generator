# Docker Compose File Generator for WordPress

## WordPress Docker API Documentation

## Overview

The WordPress Docker API provides a convenient way to generate a Docker Compose file for hosting a WordPress site on any Docker server. By utilizing this API, users can automate the process of configuring WordPress with specific settings, including the name of the site, web port, and database port.

### Base URL

```
https://wp-docker.jeetghosh3.repl.co
```

## API Endpoint

### Generate Docker Compose File

#### Endpoint

```
GET /download/
```

#### Parameters

- `name` (required): The name of your WordPress site.
- `web_port` (required): The port on which the WordPress web server will run.
- `db_port` (required): The port on which the WordPress database server will run.

#### Example

```
GET /download/?name=mywordpress&web_port=8080&db_port=3306
```

#### Response

The response will be a downloadable Docker Compose file with the specified configurations for the WordPress site.

## Example Usage

To use the API, simply make a GET request to the endpoint `/download/` with the required parameters in the query string. For example:

```
curl -o docker-compose.yml "https://wp-docker.jeetghosh3.repl.co/download/?name=mywordpress&web_port=8080&db_port=3306"
```

This will download a Docker Compose file named `docker-compose.yml` configured for a WordPress site named `mywordpress` with the web server running on port `8080` and the database server on port `3306`.

## Note

- Ensure that the provided ports are available and not in use by other services on your Docker server.
- It's recommended to customize the generated Docker Compose file further based on your specific requirements before deploying it to your Docker server.
- This API is designed for educational and testing purposes, and it's important to follow best practices for production deployments.
## Features
